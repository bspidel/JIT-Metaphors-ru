# Final Translation Practice

## Forum Post

Think of the translation strategies you just practiced. **Which strategy
is the most appropriate to translate the metaphors into your
language? **

The metaphors in the Open Bible Story are \"my son was dead, but now he
is alive!\" and \"He was lost, but now we have found him!\" 

**Click the speech bubble in the upper-right corner. **In the forum text
box, label which strategy will be the most helpful for you to translate
into your language. Type your translation in your language. 

Look through other people\'s posts to learn other possibilities for
translation. Feel free to comment if you agree or disagree with
someone\'s translation.
