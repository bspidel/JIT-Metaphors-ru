The languages used to write the Bible use metaphor. Because of this
fact, translators must be able to identify metaphors. Once
translators have identified metaphors, they must be able to determine
the point of comparison. Translators must compare the topic and image,
so that they are able to decide the best form in their native language
to communicate the meaning.

Let\'s practice explaining the point of comparison!
