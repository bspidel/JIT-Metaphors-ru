# Types of Metaphors {#types-of-metaphors .heading}

Everything you\'ve learned so far has been about the basic concepts of
metaphor. When people from a specific language and culture recognize the
metaphors that they speak or write, they are *active*. However, not all
metaphors are actively recognized by speakers or writers. Some metaphors
are used so much that they are deeply imbedded into culture and
language. These metaphors are **passive metaphors**.

A passive metaphor is a metaphor that has been used so much in the
language that its speakers no longer regard it as one concept standing
for another.\
