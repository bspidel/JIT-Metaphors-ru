Did you notice words and phrases in the comic where the meaning is not
obvious\--the language might seem strange? That\'s because those words
and phrases are figures of speech. Figures of speech are used naturally
in language. This fact makes it difficult to explain them, because
figures of speech feel so normal to the user. 

Read the comic below to experience the same conversation without figures

ideas and values, and they provide shortcuts in communication for people
who share the same language and culture.
