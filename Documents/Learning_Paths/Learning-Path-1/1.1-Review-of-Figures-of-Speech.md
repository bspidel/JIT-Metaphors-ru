## Review of Figures of Speech

>Figures of speech are ways of saying things that use words in non-literal ways. That is, the meaning of a figure of speech is not the same as the more direct meaning of its words. In order to translate the meaning, you need to be able to recognize figures of speech and know what the figure of speech means in the source language. Then you can choose either a figure of speech or a direct way to communicate that same meaning in the target language.

Not every language contains every *type* of figure of speech, but the categories of figure of speech are very common. 

The categories include:
- figures of comparison
- figures of association
- figures stressing the personal dimension
- figures of overstatement
- figures of understatement

Let's review your knowledge by answering a few questions about figures of speech. Navigate to the Activity: Figure of Speech Review on the menu on the left.
