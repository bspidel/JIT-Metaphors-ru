Navigate to
[translationAcademy](https://door43.org/u/unfoldingWord/en_ta/master/03-translate.html#figs-metaphor)
and read the section of the article titled **\"Patterned Pairs of
Concepts Acting as Metaphors.\"** Read the five paragraphs in this
section until you reach \"Active Metaphors.\" 

Understanding common pairs in a language and culture will help you think
about passive metaphors in your native language. 

-   Think about possibilities of pairs in your language
-   Talk to someone else who speaks your language to identify pairs or
    passive metaphors
-   Search the internet for further help to identify pairs or passive
    metaphors in your native language

Once you have identified a passive metaphor in your native language,
post it in the forum. If it is possible, please provide a rough
translation in English.
