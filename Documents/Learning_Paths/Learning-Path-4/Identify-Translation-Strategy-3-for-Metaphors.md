# Translation Strategies for Metaphor

## Learn the best ways to translate metaphor.

Use the translation principles you just learned as you examine metaphors
in the Bible. Often, the best translation strategy for a metaphor will
be an obvious choice. However, the difference between your native
language and English makes translation more difficult. The translation
strategies help translators make the best choice communicating the
meaning of metaphors.

### Translation Strategy 3: Choose culturally appropriate images.

1.  Identify the metaphor.
2.  Identify the parts of the metaphor.
3.  Does your culture use the same image?\
        1. If no, choose an appropriate image from your culture.

Let\'s practice this strategy! You will use the same example of Isaiah
64:8. Does the culture of your native language use the images \"clay\"
or \"potter\"? If your answer is no, provide a better cultural choice in
your native language by posting to the forum. Click the speech bubble in
the upper-right corner to post your translation.
