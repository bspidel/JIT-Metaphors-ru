# Translation Strategies for Metaphor

## Learn the best ways to translate metaphor.

Use the translation principles you just learned as you examine metaphors
in the Bible. Often, the best translation strategy for a metaphor will
be an obvious choice. However, the difference between your native
language and English makes translation more difficult. The translation
strategies help translators make the best choice communicating the
meaning of metaphors.

### Translation Strategy 5: Explain the point of comparison to the audience.

1.  Identify the metaphor.
2.  Identify the parts of the metaphor.
3.  Does your culture understand the point of comparison?\
        1. If no, explain the comparison to your audience.\
        2. Remember translation principles though: Do NOT make the
    comparison obvious, if the original audience in the Bible did not
    understand the comparison.

Let\'s practice this strategy! You will use the same example of Psalm
18:46. Does the audience of your native language understand the point of
comparison? If your answer is no, provide a translation with an
explanation of the comparison in your native language in the forum post.
