# Translation Strategies for Metaphor

## Learn the best ways to translate metaphor.

Use the translation principles you just learned as you examine metaphors
in the Bible. Often, the best translation strategy for a metaphor will
be an obvious choice. However, the difference between your native
language and English makes translation more difficult. The translation
strategies help translators make the best choice communicating the
meaning of metaphors.

### Translation Strategy 6: State the idea simply with no metaphor.

1.  Identify the metaphor.
2.  Identify the parts of the metaphor.
3.  Do none of the other strategies work for the audience of your native
    language?\
        1. If no, state the idea simply.

Let\'s practice this strategy! You will use the same example of Mark
1:17b. Does the audience of your native language understand metaphors?
If your answer is no, provide a simple translation of the idea in your
native language in the forum post. Click the speech bubble in the
upper-right corner to post your translation.
