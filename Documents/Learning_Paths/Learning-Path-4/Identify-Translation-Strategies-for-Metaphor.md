# Translation Strategies for Metaphor

## Learn the best ways to translate metaphor.

Use the translation principles you just learned as you examine metaphors
in the Bible. Often, the best translation strategy for a metaphor will
be an obvious choice. However, the difference between your native
language and English makes translation more difficult. The translation
strategies help translators make the best choice communicating the
meaning of metaphors.

### Translation Strategy 2: Translate the metaphor as a simile.

1.  Identify the metaphor.
2.  Identify the parts of the metaphor.
3.  Do people who speak your language recognize that it is a metaphor?\
        1. If yes, translate the metaphor literally.\
        2. If no, translate the metaphor as a simile.

the same example of Isaiah 64:8. Does your native language have the
metaphor \"we are the clay\" or \"You are the potter\"? If your answer
is no, provide a translation of a simile in your native language in the
forum post. Click the speech bubble in the upper-right corner to post
your translation.
