# Translation Strategies for Metaphor

## Learn the best ways to translate metaphor.

Use the translation principles you just learned as you examine metaphors
in the Bible. Often, the best translation strategy for a metaphor will
be an obvious choice. However, the difference between your native
language and English makes translation more difficult. The translation
strategies help translators make the best choice communicating the
meaning of metaphors.

### Translation Strategy 1: Translate the metaphor literally.

1.  Identify the metaphor.
2.  Identify the parts of the metaphor.
3.  Does your native language translate the metaphor the same way?
    1.  If yes, translate the metaphor literally.
    2.  If no, look for another translation strategy.
4.  Test the translation with the language community.

Does it mean the same thing? If your answer is yes, provide a
