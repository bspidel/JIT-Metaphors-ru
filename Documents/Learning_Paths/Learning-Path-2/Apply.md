The three parts of metaphor also apply to metaphors used in the Bible. 

Sometimes, metaphors in the Bible are simple: one topic for one image
for one point of comparison. Look at the example in the image below to
read a metaphor.

In this example from John 6:35, Jesus tells readers exactly what the
point of comparison is. Not all metaphors are explained for readers.

Once again, the metaphor in Psalm 23:1 is very clear. The topic is
stated and the image is easily compared to the topic.

Look at this example of a metaphor in the Bible:

King Herod is described as a fox. This time, Jesus does not tell readers
what the metaphor \"that fox\" *means*. He expects his readers to think
about the characteristics of a fox and apply those characteristics to
King Herod. 

Let\'s look at one final example of metaphor.

This time, the topic is not stated so simply. The reader must look at
the context to identify the topic that is discussed. Malachi 4:1
describes a context for evil doers that will destroy them, but the
metaphor offered in Malachi 4:2a describes an alternative for those who
fear God. The image in the metaphor is creative as it does not describe
a specific image but combines a couple of familiar images: 1) the rising
of the sun and 2) wings.
