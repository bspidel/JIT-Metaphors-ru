# Learn the 3 parts essential to translating metaphors!

A metaphor exists in a phrase. Metaphors are figures of *comparison*, so
the phrase must include topics to compare. Read the graphic below to
learn the parts of a metaphor.

Let\'s look at one of the examples from earlier in the course. We will
identify each part of the metaphor. When you read the metaphor and
identify the parts, do your best to determine what is similar between
the topic and image.

-   Do the girl and rose both have thorns? *No.*
-   Are the girl and the rose wilted? *Maybe, but we would need more
    information to make that comparison.*
-   Roses are beautiful, and the girl *I love* is beautiful to me.
    Therefore, the point of comparison connects the beauty of the girl
    and the rose.

An idea is abstract, and gold is concrete. The speaker desires the
listener to understand that the good idea is as valuable as gold.
